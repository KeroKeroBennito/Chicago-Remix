## About

Have you ever been given an essay or assignment that uses CMoS and instead of writing the essay and being able to cite your sources easily in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, worrying that your citations won't look right, or that your margins may be slightly out? Have you ever wanted a template that you can simply write in and have it all be done for you?

If you have been in that position, welcome to `Chicago-Remix` a .tex that complies with the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition, with most of the heavy lifting done by the `biblatex-chicago` package by [David Fussner](https://ctan.org/author/fussner), `Chicago-Remix` implements the majority of the CMoS standard to LaTeX, with Headings and Block quotes still being under construction.
